# MultipleHomes

A quick multiple homes plugin for Unturned I whipped up in 30 min.

## Commands:
**/Home [Name]**
Teleports you to a home

**/SetHome[Name]**
Places a new home 

**/Homes**
Lists all your homes

**/DelHome [Name]**
Removes a home

## Permissions:
**Max Homes Override:**

`MultipleHomes.MaxHomes.X` where X is the max home count.

If left out, it will default to the default max homes set in the config.
